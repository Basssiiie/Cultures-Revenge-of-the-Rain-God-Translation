After wandering through the forest, we finally saw Thorwal's woodcutter's hut.

"Greetings my friends. So you want me to rejoin you. I'd love to do that, but this year hasn't been good for my beer supplies. Everything's gone, and I can't celebrate without my beer, and without one I can't drink up the courage to celebrate properly, and unfortunately I can't accompany you without courage.
\n
But could you help me out with some fresh beer?"

Thorwal was known for his excessive consumption of beer. We chuckled knowing that even if we did deliver him a new supply of beer, it wouldn't last more than a few weeks. But this was his condition, and we were willing to do anything to have him come with us.
