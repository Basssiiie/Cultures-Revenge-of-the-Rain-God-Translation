After a long, stormy crossing, the verdant coast of Vinland emerged from the ocean tides on the horizon.
\n
My heart was filled with mixed feelings. I almost hoped I would never have to set foot there again, but there is little that a Viking holds more sacred than a debt of honor to friends and allies.
\n
\n
So I set foot again on the wide lands to the west, where lived our friends the Yellow Knives, with whom we had endured so many dangers and adventures.
\n
\n
We first had to set up camp from which to start the search for our red brothers who had so urgently asked for our help.
