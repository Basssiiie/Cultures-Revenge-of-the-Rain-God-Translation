After a long march we had reached the village of the Yellow Knives. But what we found was terrifying.
\n
\n
We knew the great people of the Yellow Knives from before, but most of their tents were now burned down. Their grand temple had been torn down. Fire and smoke greeted us as we walked among the debris of the destroyed tents.

Few of our Vinlandic friends were still alive. Anger flowed through us, but we had no time to waste now. The food supplies in their camp tents had been plundered. It was up to us to fill them up again. It was the only thing we could do for them.
