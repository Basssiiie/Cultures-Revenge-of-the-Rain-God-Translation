Our scouts fought their way through the impassable jungle for an eternity. Often they thought they had lost their way forever,
until they finally heard the soothing rippling of the river through the trees again. Then finally the jungle gave way to a large clearing and they stood in the middle of a Mayan village by the sea.

It was the Tzulucetl village. The villagers met us suspiciously but quite friendly and led us to their leader.

When he saw our men, he turned white as a sheet and called out the name of the Rain God. However, the scouts were quickly able to calm the completely frightened man and gave him some of our pottery as a gift.

When asked about the great city of the Rain God that they had had to build, his expression became hard and he refused to give even the slightest hint. But he and his wife seemed to really like our beautiful tasteful dishes...
