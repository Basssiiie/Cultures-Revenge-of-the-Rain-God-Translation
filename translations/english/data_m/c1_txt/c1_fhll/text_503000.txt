THE TRAIL
\n
<font:3>
<picture:230>
The tracker led us steadily south, following a trail that not even our best hunters could spot. Then, as we advanced mile after mile into the wooded heart of the country, we came across more and more ruined settlements of the
native Vinlander people. The unknown enemy left a trail of devastation that filled our hearts with sorrow.

\n
Often the rubble was still smoking when we examined it. I urged the men to great haste.
\n
\n
On the seventh day of our search we reached an area where the strangers had raged particularly badly. Their destructive writing on the landscape was well known to us by now. There was such a need there that I stopped our search to help the local people.
\n
\n
Knowing full well that I was giving up all hope of catching up with the enemy.
