When we got to the tribe of the Wood Walkers, we saw a picture of misery.
\n
\n
The strangers had taken everything from them, devastated their fields and burned down their wigwams. Chief Wakening Cry urgently requested our help, otherwise his tribe would not survive the next winter.
\n
\n
Even if we lost track of the creepy strangers once and for all, our priority was to help those in need.
With Odin's help we should get a new clue, I was sure.
