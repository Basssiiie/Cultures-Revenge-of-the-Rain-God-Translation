We had managed to prevent a famine! The bond of friendship with the yellow knives was renewed.
\n
\n
But who on earth was responsible for this terrible destruction? In the evening we gathered around a large fire with the surviving Yellow Knives, and the Vinlanders began to report...
\n
\n
Well, what we heard initially made us doubt the Yellow Knives' sanity. The exhausted Vinlanders told us about ghosts and spooky beastmen that attacked the village one night without warning. With wild screams they had broken out of the thicket and attacked the tribe like the demons of the underworld. Their heads were like those of animals, their bodies painted, and their voices sounded as if they came straight from the pits of the underworld.
\n
\n
The Vinlanders put up fierce resistance, but in vain! When the fight was over, they were horrified to find that the evil spirits had kidnapped Wini Puh, chief Ugga Walla's son.
Since his own warriors were too weak, the chief asked us to free his son. And how could we turn down an old friend's request for help?
\n
\n
But who were these creepy strangers? Had the Yellow Knives served us horror stories? Or was it really spirits from the underworld that had brought so much suffering to our friends?
\n
\n
We didn't think twice, but decided to confront the unknown enemy. But where should we start looking? Further north lived the people of the Red Knives tribe. They were the best trackers around. If we could hire a scout from them, we might be able to track down the mysterious strangers.
