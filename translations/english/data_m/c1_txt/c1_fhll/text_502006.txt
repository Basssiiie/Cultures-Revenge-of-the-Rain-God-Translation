After searching the eastern coastal region and almost giving up hope of finding our former settlement, we were surprised in a clearing by familiar faces.
\n
\n
Some of our brothers had survived the attack of the unknown warriors. They spoke of beasts that walked upright and with terrible ferocity had destroyed the village of the Yellow Knives and our settlement.
\n
\n
We wanted to take our Viking brothers to our new settlement, but they refused. They wanted to build the settlement anew and stronger so that they could eventually get even with these creepy warriors.
\n
\n
Befitting a Viking warrior, we respected their courage and decision. After giving them enough food and resources to begin rebuilding, we ventured further inland to look for evidence of these beastmen.
