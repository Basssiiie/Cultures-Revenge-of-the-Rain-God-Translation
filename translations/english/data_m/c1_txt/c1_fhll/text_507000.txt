Decision Day

\n
Quetzalcoatl, who we now knew was my long-lost uncle, had escaped during the battle at the temple of the rain cult and was now gathering his remaining followers to raise a new army in the south. We could not waste any more time if we wanted to get hold of him.
\n
\n
Fortunately, we had found the dragon ship in the south that my uncle had once used to land on this coast. Although it was damaged, it only took us a few days to repair it.
\n
\n
While a small group tended to the wounded on both sides, we set out with a handful of select men and women to stop the false Rain God from bringing more suffering to this land.
\n
\n
A few days later we landed on a remote coast where, according to reports from our allies, there was an ancient temple complex in the middle of a vast, inaccessible swamp area. The ideal place for my uncle and his dark machinations!
\n
\n
So now we, with our small band of brave heroes, stood against a huge force, far away from all our allies. Everything would be decided here!
