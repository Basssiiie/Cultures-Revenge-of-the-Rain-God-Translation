The Vinlander tracker read the Signs of the Wild
like our scholars in their scrolls. Now that we knew where to go, we formed a small group
who wanted to try to free the chief's son.

The other part should stay on the ship and help the locals to rebuild their villages.

Freshly strengthened and in good spirits, we began our long journey that would lead us to unexpected adventures.
