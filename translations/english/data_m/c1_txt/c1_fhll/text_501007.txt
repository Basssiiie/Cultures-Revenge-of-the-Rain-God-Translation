"Yes, I'll praise that! Fresh beer!"
\n
Thorwal rushed towards the first keg of beer in front of him and lifted it to let the tasty brew wet his throat with a huge greed.

He slowly put the barrel down again and looked at us with happy eyes.
"My whole supply of beer is replenished."
\n
With these words he raised the next barrel to his lips.
"Come drink with me, let's toast to the great things to come."

It was a long night and a long morning before we and Thorwal had drunk enough courage to head back to the village.

"Go ahead" was the sound from Thorwal's hut. "I still have a little something to do here, but as soon as the big journey begins, I'll be there."
