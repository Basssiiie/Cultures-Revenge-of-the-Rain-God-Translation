THE RUNE CIRCLE
\n
<font:3>
\n
Early one morning, the druid of your tribe comes running to you nervously and tells of a strange sign from the gods that has kept him awake.
\n
\n
Beyond the fish-rich mountain lakes there must be an ancient, abandoned burial mound. This burial mound is said to be surrounded by a rune circle that only the Vikings know. This was probably a holy place of the forefathers.
\n
\n
But in the meantime the area near the rune circle has been occupied by a hostile Vinlander tribe and the sacred ground must have been desecrated.
\n
\n
The druid reports that the gods would be angry about disturbing the peace of the holy place.

GOALS:
\n
\n
First, build a main camp and secure the food of your people.
\n
\n
Then train enough Vikings to become warriors to drive the hostile Vinlanders from sacred ground.
\n
\n
Build a brewery to supply your warriors with food on their quest for the rune circle.
\n
\n
Also explore the surrounding area and look for other tribes to trade for necessary resources and get allies.
