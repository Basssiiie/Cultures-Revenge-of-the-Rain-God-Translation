#### Notes
1. It seems the snow sculpture event was originally a bit different as it is referred to as "hermit" ("Einsiedler") in the mission code, and there is also an unused mission goal "Find the hermit".
2. This event is broken in German version where it will display as an empty briefing, due to a missing `>` in the comment tag at the top.

### Level 2 (Der Auftrag)

#### Easter eggs
1. There's a small Star Wars reference on the coast near the left edge of the map.
2. The map's creator, Ralf Angerbauer, put himself on a little island in the top-right corner, which can only be seen with the "reveal map" cheat code.
3. As referenced in the story, the bottom half of the map is actually very similar to the top-half of the Vinland level in the original campaign. It even includes the statue of liberty reference on the little island in the water.

#### Easter egg & notes

1. Another developer, Tobias Frin, can be found on a small island in the top-left corner of this map.
2. If you kill the Red Wings tribe or the Wood Walkers tribe, the mission will fail with `text_501111.txt` from the [first campaign level](#level-1-der-aufbruch).
