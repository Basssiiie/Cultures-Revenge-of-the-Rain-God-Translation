| [text_501011.txt](./Data_m/C1_txt/C1_fhll/text_501011.txt) | Finding the canoes |  |

| [text_501111.txt](./Data_m/C1_txt/C1_fhll/text_501111.txt) | Mission lost (any npc killed) | See note 2 |

#### Notes
1. It seems the snow sculpture event was originally a bit different as it is referred to as "hermit" ("Einsiedler") in the mission code, and there is also an unused mission goal "Find the hermit".
2. This event is broken in German version where it will display as an empty briefing, due to a missing `>` in the comment tag at the top.

### Level 2 (Der Auftrag / The Pledge)

| File | Occurrence | Note |
|--|--|--|
| [text_502000.txt](./Data_m/C1_txt/C1_fhll/text_502000.txt) | Opening briefing |  |
| [text_502002.txt](./Data_m/C1_txt/C1_fhll/text_502002.txt) | Death of Red Knives or the Yellow Knives | Also referenced for death of the player, but never called. |

| [text_502070.txt](./Data_m/C1_txt/C1_fhll/text_502070.txt) | Briefing Yellow Knives |  |
| [text_502100.txt](./Data_m/C1_txt/C1_fhll/text_502100.txt) | Hiring the tracker |  |

#### Easter eggs
1. There's a small Star Wars reference on the coast near the left edge of the map.
2. The map's creator, Ralf Angerbauer, put himself on a little island in the top-right corner, which can only be seen with the "reveal map" cheat code.
3. As referenced in the story, the bottom half of the map is actually very similar to the top-half of the Vinland level in the original campaign. It even includes the statue of liberty reference on the little island in the water.

### Level 3 (Die Fährte / The Trail)

| File | Occurrence | Note |
|--|--|--|
| [text_503000.txt](./Data_m/C1_txt/C1_fhll/text_503000.txt) | Opening briefing |  |
| [text_503002.txt](./Data_m/C1_txt/C1_fhll/text_503002.txt) | Death of the player? | Referenced but never called. |
| [text_503004.txt](./Data_m/C1_txt/C1_fhll/text_503004.txt) | Meeting Miguel |  |

| [text_503100.txt](./Data_m/C1_txt/C1_fhll/text_503100.txt) | Paying the tribute to the Poke Montas |  |

#### Easter egg & notes

1. Another developer, Tobias Frin, can be found on a small island in the top-left corner of this map.
2. If you kill the Red Wings tribe or the Wood Walkers tribe, the mission will fail with `text_501111.txt` from the [first campaign level](#level-1-der-aufbruch--the-departure).


### Level 4 (Die Höhle der Offenbarung / The Cave of Relevation)

| File | Occurrence | Note |
|--|--|--|
| [text_504000.txt](./Data_m/C1_txt/C1_fhll/text_504000.txt) | Opening briefing |  |
| [text_504010.txt](./Data_m/C1_txt/C1_fhll/text_504010.txt) | Mission accomplished |  |

#### Notes

- The mission script references `text_505010.txt` as the death script, which actually happens to be the mission accomplished briefing for the Arizona campaign level map. But as with other death scripts, it is never actually called and shown.
- It's not possible to kill all the Guardians in the level as one soldier is stuck in the void and cannot be reached.



## General briefings

| File | Occurrence | Note |
|--|--|--|
| [text_140203.txt](./Data_m/C1_txt/C1_fhll/text_140203.txt) | Death of the player | Seems to be used in all levels |
